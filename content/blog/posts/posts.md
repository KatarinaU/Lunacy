### Front Matter

The posts' front matter holds only three variables: the date, the tile, and the description. The description is basically the subtitle you see in the main/list page of the theme. In this case, I made it obvious by writing "This subtitle is fixed through front matter, heh."

### Release the ~~kraken~~ Markdown

The beauty of Hugo is it's ease of configuration and the usage of markdown to quickly elaborate fairly rich content, capable of inserting lists, images , links, etc. to your blog/web of choice.

I encourage you to try Hugo out, explore a bit and perhaps use my theme or create your own, as it's **really** easy to get up and running!

Happy hacking!
